# Project 2: Christmas Project

* Author: Drew Scott

## Overview

This project is a Christmas card where there is falling snow and elves 
dropping out of a sleigh. After the elves get covered with the accumulated
snow, it changes to springtime, where the elves are replaced with
gravestones.

## Compiling and Using

The code doesn't require any user input. To use, just click the link.

## Discussion

In this project, I had issues with the project scaling by screen size, which I
still haven't really figured out. I had troubles figuring out how to rotate
elements, which I did figure out. I learned how to put Google Fonts in JS. I also
learned how to change the scene based on time elapsed. I learned how to move objects.

## Testing

I tested this project by opening the local files in my browser.

## Extra Credit

I made snow accumulate.
